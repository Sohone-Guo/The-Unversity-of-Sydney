This code is for University of Sydney - SIT - Machine Learning assgnment 1, 
made by Xuhong GUO, Huixin CHEN.


? Environment: Anaconda 4.3.1 (Python 3.6.0 version)

? code (a folder):
1. algorithm (a folder): Step 1 Generate New data.py,
Step 2 Training Model.py, Step 3 Prediction.py.
2. input (a folder): empty.
3. output (a folder): predicted labels.csv

? Step 1: running the Step 1 Generate New data.py,
the program will generate a new data.csv file in input
fold.

? Step 2: running the Step 2 Training Model.py, the
program will output a model with two CSV files in
algorithm folder. One stores the unique labels in
training data. The other is the value of W, which is
corresponding to label file.

? Step 3: running the Step 3 Prediction.py, the program
will use the labels and value of W, generated in step
2, to predict the predicting file and give the predicting
label in output folder.
